## Changing the Appearance of RMarkdown {-}

Spending any significant amount of time in front of a computer, especially in front of black text on a white background, can be headache inducing. Also, if your eyesight is not great, the effect can be multiplied and stressful. 

You can change the appearance of RMarkdown, and many of us who spend hours on it usually do.

If you wish to change the appearance you can go to the tools menu and select "Global Options":

Next, click "Appearance" in the box on the left:

<center><img src="images/appearance.png"></center>

Here you can change the Editor font, font size and the editor theme (the colours of the text). Make the selections you want and then press "Apply" to make them stick.

```{block, type = "warning"}
Changing the "zoom" to too big a size can make it *extremely* difficult to use the software or to even change it back. 

Edit the **font size** and only tinker with the zoom when absolutely neccessary!
```
